# Simple Storage Smart Contract

This repository contains a simple Solidity smart contract for demonstrating basic contract development, compilation, and testing using Solidity. The `SimpleStorage` contract allows for storing and retrieving a uint value on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Contract Overview

The `SimpleStorage` contract provides two primary functions:

- `set(uint x)`: Stores a given `uint` value in the contract.
- `get() returns (uint)`: Retrieves the stored value.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js and npm installed on your computer. This project uses Solidity for smart contract development, so having `solc` (Solidity compiler) or an IDE like Remix is necessary for compiling the contract.

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. If using Remix, simply import the `SimpleStorage.sol` file to start working with the contract.
3. For local compilation and deployment, ensure you have Truffle or Hardhat setup.

## Running the Tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system (if applicable).

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system (if applicable).
